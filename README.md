# Game-Jam-SPb-2019
We with my team "Noo_Blean" created a game 
when we took part in 'Game Jam SPb 2019' and had only 24 hours for work

control is carried out by arrows
F - start dialog with NPC or shout, if no one is around

you should track 2 scales: your own time and "karma"
time runs - you hurry, but on the way you meet people
you can help them, and you can pass by and save time
when you help - your karma increases, but you lose more time

we think people must have skill time managment and remain people, not be indifferent

team "Noo_Blean":
Team Lead - Panyukov Kerey
Coders - Lobaev Leonid, Ashirali Alibek
Artist - Kolupaeva Anna
